    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spaghetti pie is a delightful Italian-inspired dish that transforms al dente
        spaghetti into a flavorful casserole. The spaghetti is mixed with eggs and
        cheese to create a sturdy base, layered with a savory filling featuring ingredients
        like seasoned ground meat, marinara sauce, and melted cheese. As it bakes, the pie
        forms a crispy golden crust while maintaining a tender interior, resulting in a harmonious
        blend of pasta, protein, and cheesy goodness that's perfect for family dinners or gatherings,
        offering both visual appeal and delicious comfort.
